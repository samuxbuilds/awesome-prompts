*Translates menus or signs while preserving the original surface texture (wall, paper, grease).*

Translate the Chinese dish names on the wall menu into English for foreign tourists. Texture Preservation : Crucial! Maintain the original aged, greasy, and textured look of the wall/paper. The new English text should look like it was written/printed on the same surface, with slight fading or wear to match. Currency : Keep the '¥' symbol and price numbers exactly as they are ; do not convert currency. Layout : align the English translations next to or replacing the Chinese characters naturally.
