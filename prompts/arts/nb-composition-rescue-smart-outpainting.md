*Expands image ratios (e.g., to 16:9) by intelligently generating matching scenery.*

Zoom out and expand this image to a 16:9 aspect ratio (computer wallpaper size). Context Awareness : Seamlessly extend the scenery on both left and right sides. Match the original lighting, weather, and texture perfectly. Logical Completion : If there are cut-off objects (like a shoulder, a tree branch, or a building edge) on the borders, complete them naturally based on logical inference. Do not distort the original center image.
