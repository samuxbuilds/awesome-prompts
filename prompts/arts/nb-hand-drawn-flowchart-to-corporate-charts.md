*Converts whiteboard sketches into clear, "McKinsey-style" vector presentations.*

Convert this hand-drawn whiteboard sketch into a professional corporate flowchart suitable for a business presentation. Style Guide : Use a minimalist 'McKinsey-style' aesthetic : clean lines, ample whitespace, and a sophisticated blue-and-gray color palette. Structure : Automatically align all boxes and diamonds to a strict grid . Connect them with straight, orthogonal arrows (90-degree angles only, no curvy lines). Text : Transcribe the handwritten labels into a clear, bold Sans-Serif font (like Arial or Roboto). Output : High-resolution vector-style image on a pure white background.
