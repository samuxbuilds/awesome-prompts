*Dresses a model in a specific garment while preserving fabric texture and lighting integration.*

Using Image 1 (the garment) and Image 2 (the model), create a hyper-realistic full-body fashion photo where the model is wearing the garment. Crucial Fit Details : The [T-shirt/Jacket] must drape naturally on the model's body, conforming to their posture and creating realistic folds and wrinkles . High-Fidelity Preservation : Preserve the original fabric texture, color, and any logos from Image 1 with extreme accuracy. Seamless Integration : Blend the garment into Image 2 by perfectly matching the ambient lighting, color temperature, and shadow direction . Photography Style : Clean e-commerce lookbook, shot on a Canon EOS R5 with a 50mm f/1.8 lens for a natural, professional look.
