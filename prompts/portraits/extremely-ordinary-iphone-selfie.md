Please draw an extremely ordinary and unremarkable iPhone selfie, with no clear subject or sense of composition — just like a random snapshot taken casually. The photo should include slight motion blur, with uneven lighting caused by sunlight or indoor lights resulting in mild overexposure. The angle is awkward, the composition is messy, and the overall aesthetic is deliberately plain — as if it was accidentally taken while pulling the phone out of a pocket.
The subjects are Eason Chan and Nicholas Tse, taken at night, next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, by Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.

## Notes
This prompt aims to generate a photo that looks very casual, even slightly like an accidental snapshot.
