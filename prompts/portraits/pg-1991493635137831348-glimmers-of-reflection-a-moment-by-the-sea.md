Calm yet haunting, a man gazes back from the weathered pier as sunset ignites the waves. The deep blues and fiery oranges create a stunning, melancholic tableau.

## Prompt

A high-resolution 8K full-length portrait of an attractive man [reference face in the photo] with dark, messy/wind-swept hair. His facial expression is calm, slightly melancholic, and he is looking back (toward the camera).

​Clothing: Wearing a dark brown or dark gray hoodie or oversized jacket with a geometric pattern on the back (white/light gray). The clothing appears loose and weathered.

​Action: Standing on the edge of a damaged wooden pier or rock, looking back toward the camera while facing the sea.

​Environment, Ambiance, and Lighting:
​Environment: Seashore or pier at sunset or dusk. Waves gently ripple and reflect light.

​Background: In the distance, the silhouettes of several sailing ships or boats anchored on the horizon.

​Aves: Numerous seabirds (Seagulls) fly in the sky, adding dynamics to the atmosphere.

​Lighting: Dramatic Golden Hour lighting. The orange-red light from the setting sun reflects strongly on the choppy water surface, creating intense orange/yellow specular highlights and glowing waves. The sky above is a deep blue/purple.

​Atmosphere: A cool, melancholic, and epic atmosphere.

​Composition:
​Composition: Vertical portrait. The character is in the center of the frame, with the wooden plank in the lower left drawing the eye inward. The waves in the lower right strongly reflect the sunset light.
