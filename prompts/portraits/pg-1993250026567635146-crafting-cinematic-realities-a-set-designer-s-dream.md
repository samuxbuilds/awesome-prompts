Can a single image encapsulate a world of stories? This stunning render captures the essence of a detective's solitude, drenched in rain and neon light, each detail whispering mysteries untold.

## Prompt

*Task: Generate a high-fidelity, cinematic-quality environment render based on a narrative brief.**

**Objective:**
Act as a professional set designer and director of photography. Given a short narrative description, generate a single, hyper-realistic image that perfectly captures the scene's mood, atmosphere, and visual detail.

**Input Parameters:**
1.  **Scene Description:** (e.g., "A lone detective sits in a dimly lit, rain-streaked diner booth at 3 AM, the neon sign outside casting a harsh red glow on his face.")
2.  **Visual Style/Era:** (e.g., "Neo-Noir," "Cyberpunk," "1950s Technicolor," "Gothic Horror")
3.  **Camera/Lens:** (e.g., "Wide-angle shot," "Close-up, 85mm lens," "Low-angle, dramatic perspective")

**Core Deliverables:**

1.  **Photorealistic Render:** A single, high-resolution image that is indistinguishable from a photograph.
2.  **Atmospheric Lighting:** The lighting must be the primary driver of the mood, utilizing complex techniques (e.g., volumetric fog, rim lighting, high-contrast chiaroscuro).
3.  **Compositional Storytelling:** The composition must guide the viewer's eye and convey the narrative tension or emotion of the scene description.
4.  **Detail & Texture:** Extreme attention to surface detail (e.g., wet asphalt, worn leather, reflections in glass).

**Workflow:**

1.  **Analyze:** Deconstruct the narrative brief into its core emotional, environmental, and lighting components.
2.  **Design:** Select the optimal camera angle and lighting setup to maximize the cinematic impact.
3.  **Render:** Generate the final image, ensuring the specified Visual Style/Era is authentically represented.
