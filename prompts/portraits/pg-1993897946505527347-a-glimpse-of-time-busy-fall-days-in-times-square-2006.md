Can you feel the buzz of late October? A young blonde stands out against the vibrant blur of Times Square, captured like a moment frozen in time from 2006.

## Prompt

Generate a photorealistic image of Time Square on a saturday in Fall 2006, it's a beautiful late October day, people are busy. in focus should be a young blonde - rest can be blurred. the photo should be reminiscent of that a digital camera from 2006 would take, with a timestamp like a printed photo would have.
