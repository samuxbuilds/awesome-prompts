Create a digital character card in RPG collectible style.
The subject is a {Programmer}, standing confidently with tools or symbols relevant to their job.
Render it in 3D cartoon style, soft lighting, vivid personality.
Include skill bars or stats like [Skill1 +x], [Skill2 +x, e.g., Creativity +10, UI/UX +8].
Add a title banner on top and a nameplate on the bottom.
Frame the card with clean edges like a real figure box.
Make the background fit the profession's theme.
Colors: warm highlights, profession-matching hues.

## Notes
Replace the {Programmer} placeholder in the prompt with specifics like "Designer", "Doctor", etc.

## Reference Image
Optional. Can be generated based on profession/role description or use an uploaded photo as reference.
