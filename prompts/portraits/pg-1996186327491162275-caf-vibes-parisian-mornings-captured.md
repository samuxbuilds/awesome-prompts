A serene Wednesday in March at a Marais café. A young woman stirs her cappuccino, lost in thought, while life buzzes around her, wrapped in the magic of crisp spring air.

## Prompt

Generate a photorealistic image of a cafe terrace in the Marais district of Paris on a Wednesday morning in March 2025. It is a crisp, cool spring morning with clear skies. Locals are drinking coffee. In sharp focus should be a young woman wearing a scarf, stirring a cappuccino and looking thoughtfully to the side; the waiter and street traffic behind her are blurred. The photo should have the candid, natural morning light feel of an iPhone image.
