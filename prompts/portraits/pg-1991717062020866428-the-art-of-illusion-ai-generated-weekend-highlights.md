Can you tell the difference? Every image in this stunning grid is AI-crafted, capturing moments that never happened. A mirror selfie, café vibes, and laughter—all imagined!

## Prompt

Generate a 9-image ‘photo dump’ grid of this person’s weekend: a mirror selfie, a café shot, friends at dinner, a blurry party photo, a walking shot, a laptop/coffee work shot, a pet moment, a sunset, and a candid laugh.
