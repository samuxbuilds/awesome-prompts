A mesmerizing snapshot from 1998 captures an artist lost in the layers of creation, painting an image from a screen, which in turn depicts their own act of artistry. The cyclical journey of inspiration unfolds on canvas!

## Prompt

Amateur photograph from 1998 of a middle-aged artist copying an image by hand from a computer screen to an oil painting on stretched canvas, but the image is itself the photo of the artist painting the recursive image.
