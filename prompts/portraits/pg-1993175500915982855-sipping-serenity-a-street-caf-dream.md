Can you feel the warmth of casual café culture? This vibrant POV shot captures a friendly face offering a steaming cup, inviting you into a bustling street scene framed by reflections and laughter.

## Prompt

Create a hyper-realistic wide-angle street-café POV photo featuring the attached face. Keep the face exactly as provided — same features, expression, and photorealistic detail. The character extends their hand toward the camera holding a cup of matcha or coffee, creating an exaggerated close-up foreground perspective. Use slight fisheye distortion, natural outdoor lighting, casual street background, reflections in the café window, real people around, candid everyday mood.
