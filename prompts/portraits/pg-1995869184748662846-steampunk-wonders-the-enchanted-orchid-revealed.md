Behold a mesmerizing fusion of nature and ingenuity! A bioluminescent orchid floats within a brass bell jar, casting electric blue light on a Victorian botanist's desk, where curiosities abound.

## Prompt

```json
{
  "prompt": "A hyper-realistic, cinematic close-up of a Victorian steampunk botanist's workbench. In the center, a heavy, oxidized brass-rimmed bell jar contains a levitating, bioluminescent orchid that glows with a pulsating electric blue light. The light from the flower illuminates dust motes dancing in the air. Next to the jar is a weathered leather field journal open to a page of complex anatomical sketches. A magnifying glass with a bone handle rests on the mahogany desk. In the background, shelves are filled with amber-colored apothecary bottles. The scene captures the texture of condensation on the glass, the grain of the wood, and the subsurface scattering of the flower petals. Shot on a 85mm macro lens, f/1.8 aperture, low-key lighting with high contrast.",
