Say goodbye to tedious searches! This 3x3 cinematic grid reveals stunning shots, complete with sleek Japanese labels, transforming your visual storytelling.

## Prompt

<instruction>
Analyze the input image composition. Identify the key subjects and their environment.
Generate a coherent 3x3 grid "Contact Sheet" showcasing 9 different cinematic shots of these subjects.
**Crucially, overlay stylish, modern, and cinematic Japanese text labels at the bottom of each panel.**

Adjust standard shot types to fit the content:

Row 1 (Establishment):
1. Extreme Long Shot (ELS): Subjects appear small within a vast environment. [Label text: "大遠景"]
2. Long Shot (LS): Complete subject visible from top to bottom. [Label text: "全身"]
3. Medium Long Shot (MLS): Framed from knees up. [Label text: "ニーショット"]

Row 2 (Core Coverage):
4. Medium Shot (MS): Framed from waist up. Focus on interaction. [Label text: "ウェストアップ"]
5. Medium Close-Up (MCU): Framed from chest up. [Label text: "バストアップ"]
6. Close-Up (CU): Tight framing on the face. [Label text: "アップ"]

Row 3 (Details & Angles):
7. Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Macro focus on **specific body features or jewelry (e.g., an ear with an earring, an eye, or a hand). Do not focus on plain fabric or object textures.** [Label text: "ディテール"]
8. Low Angle Shot: **Extreme low angle shooting upwards from the ground to create a dynamic, towering perspective.** [Label text: "ローアングル"]
9. High Angle Shot: Looking down on the subject from above. [Label text: "俯瞰"]

Ensure strict consistency: same subjects, clothes, and lighting.
**The text overlays must be written clearly in a sleek, professional Japanese font, avoiding generic styles.**
</instruction>

Middle Row: Waist-up ("ウェストアップ"), chest-up ("バストアップ"), face close-up ("アップ").
