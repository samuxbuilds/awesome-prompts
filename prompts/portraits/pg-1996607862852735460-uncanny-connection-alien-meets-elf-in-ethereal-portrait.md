Two worlds collide in this striking close-up: an alien and an elf, each with hauntingly similar emerald and obsidian eyes, locked in an emotionless gaze that captivates and unsettles.

## Prompt

Extreme close-up portrait of two faces pressed together: on the left a bald, pale grey-skinned alien humanoid with large glossy emerald-green eyes, elongated skull, thin lips and wrinkled translucent skin showing veins underneath, on the right a woman elf with short black hair hair, pale skin and the exact same intense black eyes, both staring directly into the camera with calm emotionless expressions, soft diffused studio lighting from the front, muted desaturated color palette with subtle green tones, hyper-realistic skin texture and pores, micro-details, shallow depth of field, unsettling and mysterious mood, super realistic.
