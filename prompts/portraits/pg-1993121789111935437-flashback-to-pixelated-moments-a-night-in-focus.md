Caught in a candid flash! This close-up captures a young woman's essence in a nostalgic digital snapshot, blending sharp highlights with soft shadows in a retro kitchen scene.

## Prompt

Use facial feature of attached photo. A close-up shot of a young woman displayed on the screen of a compact Canon digital camera. The camera body surrounds the image with its buttons, dials, and textured surface visible, including the FUNC/SET wheel, DISP button, and the “IMAGE STABILIZER” label along the side. The photo on the screen shows the woman indoors at night, illuminated by a bright built-in flash that creates sharp highlights on her face and hair. She has long dark hair falling across part of her face in loose strands, with a soft, slightly open-lip expression. The flash accentuates her features against a dim, cluttered kitchen background with appliances, shelves, and metallic surfaces softly blurred. The mood is candid, raw, nostalgic, and reminiscent of early 2000s digital camera snapshots. Colors are slightly muted with cool undertones, strong flash contrast, and natural grain from the display. No text, no logos inside the photo preview itself.
