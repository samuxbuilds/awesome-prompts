*Isolates products from messy backgrounds and places them in a high-end commercial studio setting.*

Identify the main product in the uploaded photo (automatically removing any hands holding it or messy background details). Recreate it as a premium e-commerce product shot . Subject Isolation : Cleanly extract the product, completely removing any fingers, hands, or clutter . Background : Place the product on a pure white studio background (RGB 255, 255, 255) with a subtle, natural contact shadow at the base to ground it. Lighting : Use soft, commercial studio lighting to highlight the product's texture and material. Ensure even illumination with no harsh glare. Retouching : Automatically fix any lens distortion, improve sharpness, and color-correct to make the product look brand new and professional .
