In a hushed moment, a single cheek gleams under ghostly window light. Messy hair and a worn cardigan blend with the artistic chaos behind, creating a haunting cinematic essence.

## Prompt

Same face preserved, shot in near-dark with only a dim window glow hitting one cheek. Hair messy and low-lit, shadows swallowing half her features. She’s in a worn black cardigan. Background: scribbles, cutouts, and film stills that appear only as rough silhouettes. The frame feels underexposed on purpose — gritty, quiet, cinematic.
