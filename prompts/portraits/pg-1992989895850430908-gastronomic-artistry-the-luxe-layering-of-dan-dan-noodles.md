Behold the elegance of Dan Dan Noodles! Each layer, from fiery chili flakes to glossy broth, tells a delicious story, masterfully crafted for an upscale culinary experience.

## Prompt

At the very top center of the composition, floating prominently above the ingredient layers, is a luxurious title label. The text reads "担担面 DAN DAN NOODLES" rendered in expressive, handwritten Chinese brush calligraphy (毛笔字) style. The lettering possesses a heavy, three-dimensional sculpted gold metal texture (金属质感) with a brushed finish, warm golden sheen, and realistic metallic reflections catching the dramatic studio lighting. It looks like forged gold brushstrokes floating in space.
Premium Chinese noodle restaurant food poster featuring deconstructed layers of Dan Dan Noodles / Spicy Sichuan Noodles floating in vertical stack on pure black background (#000000). Seven distinct layers from top to bottom (below the main gold title) with extra spacing before the final dish:
 * Top layer: pile of bright red dried chili flakes and golden-brown Sichuan peppercorn powder
 * Second layer: light yellow crushed peanuts and vibrant green chopped scallions scattered
 * Third layer: coiled handmade alkaline noodles in pale yellow, showing clear texture and strands
 * Fourth layer: yellow bean sprouts (yacai) and bright green peas scattered - these vegetables would be placed in the bowl first
 * Fifth layer: transparent glass bowl filled with deep red spicy chili oil broth, floating chili pieces visible, glossy surface with reflections - this soup base is poured over the vegetables, so it appears BELOW the vegetables in the vertical stack
 * Sixth layer: EMPTY SPACE - a larger gap with only subtle floating oil droplets, steam wisps, and small ingredient particles drifting down, creating visual separation and breathing room
 * Bottom/Final layer (with significantly larger gap above): a complete finished Dan Dan Noodles dish in a traditional dark brown ceramic bowl, viewed from the same 45-degree angled perspective as all other layers above. The bowl contains all ingredients combined - pale yellow noodles coated in glossy red chili oil, topped with crushed peanuts, bright green chopped scallions, bean sprouts, peas, and red chili flakes sprinkled on top. The noodles look freshly mixed and glistening with oil, subtle steam rising. This finished bowl is at the same scale and viewing angle as the deconstructed ingredients above. The extra spacing above emphasizes this as the final result, creating a dramatic reveal of the transformation from separated components to complete dish.
Each layer separated with gaps revealing textures and details. Layers 1-5 have normal spacing between them. Layer 6 is an intentional empty transition space with double or triple the normal gap distance. Layer 7 (finished dish) sits at the bottom with clear visual separation. Chinese and English bilingual labels with elegant arrows pointing to each component: "辣椒油&花椒粉 Chili Oil & Sichuan Pepper Powder", "麻辣风味 Numbing & Spicy Flavor", "花生碎&葱花 Crushed Peanuts & Scallions", "手工碱面 Handmade Noodles", "芽菜&豌豆 Yacai & Peas", "丰富配料 Rich Toppings", "红油汤底 Spicy Red Broth", "成品 Finished Dish".
NO white pedestal, NO platform base. All layers float freely in space against pure black background. Dramatic studio lighting from 45-degree angle, rim lighting highlighting textures and glass bowl transparency. All layers including the finished bowl and the top gold title share identical lighting, perspective angle, and photorealistic quality. Subtle steam effects, oil droplets floating around layers, with more particles in the empty transition space. Star sparkle effect in bottom right corner near the finished dish. Dark moody aesthetic, luxurious commercial food photography style, ultra-realistic, highly detailed, professional restaurant advertising quality, 9:16 vertical format.
