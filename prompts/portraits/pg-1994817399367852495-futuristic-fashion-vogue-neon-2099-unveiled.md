A striking blend of technology and art, this cover features a gender-fluid model radiating bioluminescence, draped in ever-changing patterns.

## Prompt

Design a high-fashion magazine cover from the year 2099 titled "VOGUE NEON". The model is a gender-fluid humanoid with bioluminescent skin, wearing an outfit made of programmable fabric that shifts patterns. The background is a clean, glossy white studio with floating AR interface elements. Use sleek typography, QR-style elements, and a minimal layout. Add fake barcodes and futuristic headlines.
