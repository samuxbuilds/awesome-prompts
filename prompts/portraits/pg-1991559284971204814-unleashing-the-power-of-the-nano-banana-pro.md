Bold, fierce, and unapologetically unique! This alternative style icon commands attention with her striking tattoos and confident pose, embodying the spirit of the Nano Banana Pro. 🍌

## Prompt

A bold, alternative-style young woman in her mid-20s with a powerful, confident attitude. She has a half-shaved undercut hairstyle: one side closely shaved, the other side long, straight platinum-blonde hair falling over her shoulder. Her skin is light-medium with a natural matte finish, showing realistic skin texture, subtle pores, faint micro-imperfections, and soft natural highlights. No plastic smoothness. Her makeup is sharp but realistic: defined brows, warm smokey eyes, clean eyeliner, and matte pink lips. Her gaze is piercing and dominant.
Her upper body and arms are covered in detailed black-and-grey tattoos: large floral pieces, bold linework, realistic shading, and a coiled dragon tattoo across her lower abdomen. Her neck features layered ornamental motifs. Tattoos look slightly textured.
She wears a black fitted crop top and an open beige shirt with rolled sleeves. Accessories include layered black chokers, thin chains, small black earrings, and subtle piercings.
Pose: She stands with both hands placed behind her head, elbows lifted wide in a strong V-shape. Fingers loosely interlocked. This pose raises her shoulders slightly and forms a subtle S-curve through her torso. Her head tilts a few degrees while maintaining direct eye contact with the viewer. Posture grounded and assertive.
Background: A deep red studio backdrop, matte and slightly textured. Subtle gradient shadows around the edges. Clean, minimal, high-fashion red atmosphere.
Lighting: Moody low-key studio lighting. A warm key light from the front-left enhances natural skin grain and pores without over-smoothing. A soft rim light from the right outlines her hair and shoulders. Gentle, realistic shadow transitions along her torso and arms. Balanced cinematic contrast.
Camera & Technical: Full-frame camera with a 50mm or 85mm lens at f/2.2. Wider composition to keep both elbows fully inside the frame.
High-resolution but non-airbrushed rendering, preserved micro-detail, slight film-like grain, soft vignette, deep red color depth. No beauty-filter effect.
Mood & Imperfections: Realistic, powerful, alternative, stylish. Visible fine skin texture, tiny freckles, mild uneven highlights, soft grain in shadows for natural authenticity.
