Crafting stickers that celebrate real beauty! This set captures every exquisite detail of the woman's features, from her lively eyes to her voluminous hair, adorned with playful elements like rainbows and hearts.

## Prompt

Create a sticker set maintaining 100% of the woman's original facial features from the provided image. Do not alter the face, focusing on ultra-realistic details of the facial structure, eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and expression. The final face must be realistic, not cartoon-like. She has long, voluminous hair.
1. Makeup: Maintain Original Face: We will preserve the structure of your face, eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth,and expression as closely as possible to the original image to maintain naturalness and uniqueness, while adjusting the tone to be softer:
Eyes: Slightly reduce the sharpness of the Cat Eye eyeliner to a thin line close to the lash line for a softer look, while still maintaining eye definition.
Eyeshadow: Use natural tones like light brown, peach, or beige.
Eyebrows: Original shape, but brushed up to look softer and more natural.
Lips: Glossy, pink-tinted, nude-pink, or coral-toned lipstick/tint to make the lips look full and moisturized. Focus on a bright but not overly intense look.
2. Hairstyle: Natural Voluminous Long Hair: Her hair is long and flowing, but the styling will emphasize natural volume and movement. Soft, natural waves.
3. Outfit:
Attire: A white open-back bodysuit paired with distressed, faded blue denim shorts.
Shoes: Elegant, simple open-toe flat sandals.
4.Accessories: Styled freely and fittingly for each scene. 4. Poses & Sticker Elements: Poses: Various poses such as waving, jumping, walking playfully, reading a book, holding up a sign, cheering with both hands, stretching, or making a celebratory gesture, to create a cheerful and friendly atmosphere. Decoration: Include elements like small rainbows, sparkling stars, clear bubbles, hearts, balloons, or light-colored dots to decorate and enhance the fun of each sticker scene.
https://t.co/SsVnXsGBGZ: Thin black border around the sticker. Use a modern, rounded 'Itim' style font for the text. Text: Add short emotional phrases written in a cute, beautiful Thai script near the sticker (no speech bubbles/text boxes):

"Hello" "LoveU" "Bye" "Cool" "Yes"
"Thank You" "Sorry" "Ok" "No"
"So cute" "SO GOOD" "Good Luck"
"GOOD Night" "GOOD Bye" "555"
"Oh" "HBD" "OMG" "Hapyy" "Hi"
6.Guidelines: Do not include a text box. Ensure balanced composition with sufficient white space—not cluttered. Match the pose to the text.

Emphasis: Reiterate 'maintain 100% of the original face features from the provided image,' 'ultra-realistic facial detail,' and 'professional studio lighting on face (realistic face, not cartoon face).'"
