Elegance radiates as she lounges by the poolside under soft lights. With playful eyes and a relaxed pose, her effortless beauty captivates the serene night.

## Prompt

Create a realistic portrait of a young woman (keep the face and appearance 100% identical to the reference — do not alter anything). The woman is in the water beside a metal pool ladder at night. The poolside tiles are small gray squares. In the background, there are folded white umbrellas with red trim and a row of white lounge chairs. The pool lights and surrounding area give off a warm, dim glow. The woman’s pose: her left arm rests along the pool edge, and her chin is placed on her right hand. She is wearing a black string-tie bikini. She has narrow rimless glasses (slightly slipping down the bridge of her nose). Her hair is the same as the reference, with a small strand falling across her face. The flower behind her ear has been removed. Her hair moves subtly in the breeze, giving a cool, stylish, slightly sexy vibe with volume. Her makeup: soft pink blush, rosy tint on cheeks and nose, full lips in a pink-peach tone. Fair, smooth skin reflecting the flash light. She is looking to the side with a cute, dreamy, slightly playful expression. Overall atmosphere: quiet, luxurious, and subtly sexy. Tone & Camera: A digital camera from the 2000s (Canon IXUS, Sony Cyber-shot, Casio Exilim).

Shot with direct flash at night.

The photo has a soft white-pink cast, bright skin tones, slight grain, sharp skin details, and distinct flash reflections on the skin.
