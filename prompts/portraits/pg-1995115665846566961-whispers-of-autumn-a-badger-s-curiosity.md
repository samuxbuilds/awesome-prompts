Golden light dances through rust-colored hollyhocks, where a curious badger explores a quaint garden bench. This soft watercolor scene captures the serene beauty of fall.

## Prompt

A small garden bench nestled among tall, rust-colored hollyhocks and fallen leaves. A curious badger sniffs around the base of the bench, while warm afternoon light filters through the golden foliage. Rendered in soft watercolor style with rich autumn tones, gentle textures, and a calm, heartwarming mood.
