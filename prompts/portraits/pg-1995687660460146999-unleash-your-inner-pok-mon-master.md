Ready to conquer the arena? This stunning portrait captures a Pokémon trainer, outfitted in Ash Ketchum's iconic style, alongside a vibrant Pikachu-like partner, reflecting the electric energy of battle!

## Prompt

Hyper-realistic editorial portrait of the person in the uploaded image set inside a real Pokemon-world arena. Outfit inspired by Ash Ketchum: fitted blue-and-white jacket with bold color blocking, short-sleeve layering, fingerless gloves, dark fitted jeans or cargo-style pants, and classic Ash-style red-and-white cap (adapted to match the person’s hairstyle). Sneakers should feel adventure-ready, with hints of red, white, and blue that echo Ash’s palette. The person is holding a pokeball in his hand. A full-scale Pikachu-like partner stands beside them, equal to or slightly taller, with dense realistic fur, vibrant electric yellows, and subtle red accents. The creature feels alive and alert. Set both characters on a glossy reflective battle-arena floor. Background glows with an electric yellow to deep crimson gradient, layered with charged haze and drifting sparks, like the arena is powering up. Both the person and the creature are cleanly reflected on the floor. Warm dramatic key light and a crisp rim light shape the skin, fabric, and fur. Cinematic shallow depth of field, subtle film grain, fully photoreal integration, ultra-detailed 8K quality.
