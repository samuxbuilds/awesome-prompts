On the edge of darkness, Batman contemplates his path. Raindrops dance on neon streets below, while his iconic mask hangs heavy in thought. A breathtaking urban tableau unfolds, blending sharp detail with cinematic magic.

## Prompt

Cinematic portrait of Batman (mask off) sitting on a rain-soaked skyscraper edge at night, one leg bent, the other dangling, holding his mask. Urban neon city with wet streets glows below. Wind blows his tousled curls as he looks up, lost in thought—reflective, moody, cinematic bokeh, sharp detail, ambient rain, glass reflections, 8K vertical bird’s-eye shot. Keep the face same as the uploaded image.
