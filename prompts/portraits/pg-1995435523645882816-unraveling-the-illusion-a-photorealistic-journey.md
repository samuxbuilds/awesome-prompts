How does a simple garment transform into a visual riddle? This striking portrait challenges perceptions, where paper meets skin in a seamless illusion. A must-see!

## Prompt

SUBJECT: Ultra photorealistic, full-body portrait of a person standing with their back mostly to the camera (rear view), looking back over the shoulder at the camera. The person is wearing a top and a pair of bottoms (pants, shorts, or a skirt).
Conceptual Trick Photography / Visual Effect (Mousatsu - 妄撮): The garment worn on the lower body (the bottoms) must be rendered as if it's a single, flat piece of paper printed with the original garment's pattern, pasted onto the body. This printed paper is horizontally and sharply torn in a single, continuous line located across the lower back, specifically in a position that reveals a strip of her skin. The tear must span from the left edge to the right edge of the frame. The tear line, while jagged, should maintain a predominantly straight overall appearance. This tear cuts through the garment, exposing a clear strip of the bare skin beneath the printed paper, as if a section of the paper has been removed. The cross-section of the torn paper must be visibly thin and clearly textured, with the edges slightly peeled or curled, naturally blending the transition between the paper and the exposed skin.

Aesthetic: Ultra photorealistic, hyperdetailed, natural soft studio lighting, high resolution.
