Captured in a single moment, this snapshot reveals the raw beauty of youth—a young woman in soft light, echoes of nostalgia shimmer through the camera's lens.

  "prompt": "Use the facial features of the attached reference image. A close-up, vertical 4:5 shot showing the image of a young woman displayed on the rear screen of a compact Canon-style digital camera. The camera body frames the image: visible buttons, dials, textured grip, a FUNC/SET wheel, DISP button, and an 'IMAGE STABILIZER' label on the side. The photo on the camera screen is an indoor night candid taken with on-camera flash: harsh direct built-in flash creates bright, sharp highlights on her face and hair, strong specular reflections and high contrast with deep, soft shadows. She has long dark hair with loose strands partially across her face, slightly open-lip soft expression, natural skin texture, true-to-reference facial proportions. Background seen through the camera screen: a dim, cluttered kitchen with blurred appliances, shelves, and metallic surfaces (soft bokeh), low ambient light. Overall mood: candid, raw, nostalgic, early-2000s digital-camera snapshot. Colors slightly muted with cool undertones; authentic display grain and subtle electronic screen glow visible on the camera display—do NOT remove display grain. Simulate compact camera lens equivalent 28–35mm, aperture f/2.8, ISO 400, shutter 1/60 with flash. White balance: auto flash. Include realistic camera body materials: matte plastic texture, small scuffs, reflections on buttons, and visible screen bezel. No text, no logos, no visible camera brand names inside the photo preview. Highly detailed face matching reference, natural pores and hair strands, believable flash speculars, film-like/early-digital sensor grain, and realistic screen pixel structure and slight bloom from the display.",
  "negative_prompt": "no watermarks, no added text or logos in the photo preview, no extra limbs, no unnatural facial distortions, no anime/cartoon style, no soft-focus that removes skin detail, no over-smoothing or excessive AI skin retouching, avoid unnatural color casts (unless subtle cool undertone), no duplicate faces, no visible brand names on camera screen or body.",
