Transform your likeness into a dynamic Pokémon Trainer! Create an epic card featuring you and your favorite Pokémon, bursting with elemental energy and stunning details.

## Prompt

Add one reference image and provide the output.

NAME :  
POKÉMON NAME :  

Generate a clean, digital illustration of a full-art Pokémon TCG card design, viewed as a flat, scan-like digital asset (not a photo of a physical object). Transform the person in the uploaded photo into an anime-style Pokémon Trainer, maintaining their likeness. Pair them in a dynamic action pose alongside a [POKÉMON NAME]. The background should be intense elemental energy matching the Pokémon's type.

Ensure the image contains ONLY the card design with NO hands holding it and NO background surface.

Based on the Pokémon, creatively invent and render all card details, including an appropriate HP number, trainer title, two attack names with damage numbers and effect text, and flavor text at the bottom. Render all text in high-resolution, sharp, official font. Place the name [NAME] at the top header.

Aspect Ratio: 3:4
