Captured in soft shadows and stark light, a young woman reflects in solitude. Her denim-clad silhouette, paired with the nostalgic glow of a yellow tube light, creates a poignant contrast that whispers stories of the night.

## Prompt

“A young woman with a contemplative expression, seated casually at an old metal bus stop at night. She wears a faded denim jacket over a dark turtleneck and loose cream trousers. A single dull yellow tube light overhead casts harsh, uneven illumination. The rest of the scene fades into darkness with subtle retro grain. Medium portrait framing, calm but cold mood.”
