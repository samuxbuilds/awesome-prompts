Breeze in the hair, moonlit whispers, and a playful smile—this portrait captures the essence of spontaneous journeys under a starry sky.

## Prompt

Use the exact face of the uploaded person and preserve their facial features without alteration. Create a cinematic night-drive portrait of the subject leaning slightly out of a moving car window while remaining seated inside the vehicle. The subject turns their head back toward the camera with a relaxed, intimate, slightly playful expression. Wind moves through their hair as the car travels along a dimly lit road.
Soft streetlights stretch into glowing trails across the background, and the sky is a deep navy blue with moonlight diffused behind thin clouds. The lighting is low-contrast and moody, with a soft, dreamy film-like grain. The overall color palette blends dark blue tones with soft pink accents, creating a dreamy night atmosphere: deep navy sky, desaturated cool hues, gentle warm skin tones, and realistic low-saturation streetlight streaks with a subtle vintage bluish-grey cinematic mood.
If the subject is female, dress them in a loose, off-shoulder cream knit sweater that drapes casually down one shoulder, adding warmth and softness.
If the subject is male, dress them in a simple cream knit sweater with a clean neckline, fitted enough to look classic and comfortable.
Camera angle: shot from inside the car, close and intimate, focusing primarily on the subject’s face and wind-swept hair while showing them leaning slightly toward the open window. The subject is always positioned inside the vehicle, facing the camera in this same posture
