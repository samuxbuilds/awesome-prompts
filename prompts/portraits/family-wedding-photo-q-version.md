Transform the people in the photo into chibi-style 3D characters. The parents are dressed in Western wedding attire — the father in a formal suit, the mother in a wedding gown. The child is a beautiful flower girl holding a bouquet.

The background features a colorful floral arch.
The characters are in 3D chibi style, while the environment is photorealistic.
The entire scene is placed inside a photo frame.

## Reference Image
