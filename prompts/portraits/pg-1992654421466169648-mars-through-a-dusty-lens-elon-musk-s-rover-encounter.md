Caught in the harsh Martian light, Elon Musk gazes intensely into the rover's lens, revealing a weathered visage and a story of exploration etched in every line.

## Prompt

Raw wide-angle engineering camera footage from the Mars surface. Extreme fisheye lens distortion. A close-up "selfie" of Elon Musk peering into the rover's lens. He is wearing a dusty, scuffed futuristic space suit (helmet off). His face is weathered, unshaven, and sun-damaged. The lens is covered in red dust particles and scratches. Harsh, direct sunlight casts deep black shadows. Low-resolution, monochrome transmission artifacts, digital timestamp overlay in the corner "SOL 001".
