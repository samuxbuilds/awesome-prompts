Caught in a flash of nostalgia, a young woman at a payphone channels 2000s vibes. The red timestamp adds urgency to her detached gaze, as blurred city lights swirl behind her, showcasing a moment that feels both distant and immediate.

## Prompt

Nighttime flash photo with Y2K aesthetic, red digital timestamp in corner. Young woman at a public payphone, face based on uploaded image, turning back toward camera with a detached look. Wearing corset top and loose cargo jeans, nands in back pockets. Strong flash contrast and blurred car lights in urban background, raw early-2000s paparazzi vibe.
