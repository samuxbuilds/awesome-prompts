A heart-stopping leap! The snowmobile defies gravity as it soars off an icy edge, with the rider's focus sharp amid a flurry of white snow. Pure adrenaline captured in motion!

## Prompt

A snowmobile launching off a jagged ice ridge in mid-air, rider leaning forward with full throttle, snow exploding upward from the takeoff point. Freezing whiteout conditions, hard blue overcast light, dynamic wide-angle perspective, strong motion blur on the background while the rider remains crispy sharp, high-speed sports photography style.
