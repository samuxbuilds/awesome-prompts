What if your outfit could literally tear away? This striking portrait blurs the lines between fashion and art, revealing the beauty beneath a paper layer.

  "title": "Mousatsu - Rear-view paper-tear bottoms (photorealistic)",
  "prompt": "Ultra-photorealistic, full-body rear-view portrait of an adult person (explicitly age 25+) standing with their back mostly to the camera and looking back over the shoulder toward the lens. The subject wears a normal top and a pair of bottoms (pants, shorts, or skirt) whose lower-body surface is rendered as a single flat sheet of paper printed with the original garment's pattern. The paper-printed bottoms are horizontally and sharply torn in one continuous jagged line across the lower back, revealing a narrow horizontal strip of bare skin across the lower back. The torn line runs from the left edge to the right edge of the frame; although jagged, it forms an overall predominantly straight horizontal cut. Show the thin cross-section of the torn paper with visible paper fiber texture; edges are slightly peeled and curled, naturally blending into the skin. The exposed skin strip is tasteful and non-sexualized. Composition: full body centered, wide horizontal frame, the tear aligned approximately at lower-back / waist level so the exposed strip is clearly visible across the frame. Lighting: natural soft studio lighting, subtle rim light to separate subject from background, realistic skin shading and subsurface scattering. Camera: simulated 85mm portrait lens, shallow depth of field but full body in pleasing focus, high resolution and hyper-detailed (skin pores, hair strands, paper fiber, printed pattern on paper, tiny tears and curl shadows). Color and texture: original garment pattern accurately reproduced on the paper, realistic fabric-to-paper transition, correct cast shadows where paper lifts, believable shadow from torn edges on the skin. Pose and mood: natural relaxed stance, looking back over shoulder at camera, neutral expression. Style: ultra photorealistic, hyperdetailed, cinematic, high resolution, 8k render quality. Safety: subject is an adult (25+), tasteful non-explicit depiction, avoid sexualization. Include precise physical realism and material studies for paper, skin, and cloth/paper edges.",

    "Confirm subject age 25+ in metadata to avoid underage depiction.",
    "When reproducing the original garment pattern on the paper, match scale and perspective so printed design aligns with body curvature but remains visibly printed-on-paper (no cloth wrinkles except where paper curls at tear).",
    "The exposed skin strip must be narrow and tasteful — do NOT reveal breasts or intimate areas. Keep the reveal limited to a horizontal band of lower-back skin.",
    "Emphasize realistic paper cross-section (thinness, fibers) and subtle shadows where paper detaches from skin.",
    "Prioritize photoreal material rendering over stylization."
