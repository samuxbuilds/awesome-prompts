## Prompt

```json
{
  "prompt": "A medium-length portrait of a young woman standing indoors, posing in a casual outfit. She has a dark ponytail hairstyle. She is wearing a light purple and pink patterned crop top and dark, loose-fitting pants with a white and black floral or geometric pattern. Over the top, she wears a long, chunky, moss green or olive green ribbed knit cardigan with a hood, which is draped over one shoulder, revealing the crop top. She is looking directly towards the camera over her shoulder with a soft expression. The background suggests an interior space, possibly a bedroom or hallway, with a glimpse of a bed on the left, a closet or wardrobe on the right, and a dark welcome mat or rug on the floor. The lighting is soft interior light, emphasizing the textures of the knitwear and the patterns of the clothing.",
