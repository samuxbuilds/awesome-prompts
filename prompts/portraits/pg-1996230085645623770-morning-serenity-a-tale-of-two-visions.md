A tranquil London morning unfolds as a young woman savors her tea, lost in thought. The city buzzes softly around her, inviting a moment of peaceful reflection.

## Prompt

Create a photorealistic image of a young woman sitting at a relaxed outdoor restaurant in London on a cool Wednesday morning in March 2025. The sky is clear, the spring air is crisp, and the city feels calm as it wakes up. She is the focal point of the shot—wearing a light scarf, gently stirring her tea while gazing off to the side with a thoughtful expression. Everything behind her, from the waiter moving about to the soft morning traffic, should fall into a smooth blur, giving the picture the effortless, candid atmosphere of a moment casually snapped on a phone.
