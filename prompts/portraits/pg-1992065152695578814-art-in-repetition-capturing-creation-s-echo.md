A whimsical snapshot from '98, revealing an artist's journey as they translate pixels to brush strokes. Can you spot the recursion in this intriguing visual narrative?

## Prompt

Amateur photograph from 1998 of a middle-aged artist copying an image by hand from a computer screen to an oil painting on stretched canvas, but the image is itself the photo of the artist painting the recursive image.
