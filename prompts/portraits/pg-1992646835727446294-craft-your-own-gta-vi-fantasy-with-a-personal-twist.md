How about your face gracing a bold game cover? Picture a neon-lit LA skyline, complete with palm trees and sleek cars, all featuring your custom character in the latest streetwear!

## Prompt

Create a PlayStation 5 game cover in the style of GTA VI. Use the man from the provided photo as the main character, but with updated LA streetwear (bomber, sunglasses, modern vibe). Neon Los Angeles background with palm trees, downtown skyscrapers, sunset colors, luxury cars, and dynamic GTA-style panel layout. Cinematic lighting, glossy poster finish, bold Rockstar-like typography. Add PS5 banner, game logo, and a high-energy Los Angeles atmosphere.
