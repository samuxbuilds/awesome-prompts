A hand casts a perfect shadow of Nano Banana Pro, elegantly merging light and form. This minimalist scene celebrates the beauty of skincare, revealed in soft sunlight.

## Prompt

A minimal sunlit wall. Sharp, elongated shadow of a human hand holding the exact product from the uploaded image. Recreate the product’s silhouette precisely in the shadow, accurate bottle shape, cap, edges, proportions. Project the product’s real label text (taken from the uploaded image) onto the shadow in clean, crisp white typography, perfectly matching placement, spacing, and size.Warm afternoon sunlight, soft grain, smooth beige wall texture. Ultra-minimal, high-end skincare aesthetic. No extra objects, no color except the natural wall tone. Artistic shadow-play composition, subtle dreamy atmosphere, natural imperfections on the wall, gently diffused light
