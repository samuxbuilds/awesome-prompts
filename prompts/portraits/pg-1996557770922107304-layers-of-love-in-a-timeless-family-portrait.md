A striking black-and-white portrait captures a family’s bond. The dynamic layering of profiles reveals deep connections, while dramatic shadows lend an air of mystery.

## Prompt

A studio portrait of a family of three: a man, a woman, and a 1-year-old girl
All three faces are shown in profile, looking to the left.
The faces overlap each other, creating a layered effect:
•the man is in the background (left),
•the woman is in the center,
•the girl is in the foreground (right).

Each face is positioned slightly higher than the previous one, creating a dynamic vertical rhythm.

Dramatic studio lighting:
A single narrow directional light source brightly illuminates only the side of the faces closest to us, emphasizing their contours and features.
Impenetrable shadows fall on the background and on the side of the faces turned away from the viewer, creating high contrast and a sense of depth.

Black-and-white photograph.
Black shirts.
Focused facial expressions.
Their gazes are directed into the distance.
Black studio background.

Deep depth of field — all three faces must be equally sharp and detailed.
Photorealistic image, studio portrait, film grain effect, DSLR quality, 85 mm lens.
Image Ratio 3:4
