*Transforms casual photos into professional studio headshots using specific lens and lighting instructions.*

Keep the facial features of the person in the uploaded image exactly consistent . Dress them in a professional navy blue business suit with a white shirt, similar to the reference image. Background : Place the subject against a clean, solid dark gray studio photography backdrop . The background should have a subtle gradient , slightly lighter behind the subject and darker towards the edges (vignette effect). There should be no other objects. Photography Style : Shot on a Sony A7III with an 85mm f/1.4 lens , creating a flattering portrait compression. Lighting : Use a classic three-point lighting setup . The main key light should create soft, defining shadows on the face. A subtle rim light should separate the subject's shoulders and hair from the dark background. Crucial Details : Render natural skin texture with visible pores , not an airbrushed look. Add natural catchlights to the eyes . The fabric of the suit should show a subtle wool texture.Final image should be an ultra-realistic, 8k professional headshot.
