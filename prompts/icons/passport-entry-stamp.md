Create a realistic passport page with an entry stamp for [{City}, {Country}]. The stamp should say "Welcome to {City}" in bold English, designed in a round or oval shape with decorative borders. Include the word "ARRIVAL" and a fictional date like "15 APR 2025" Incorporate a subtle silhouette of {Main Landmark} as a background detail within the stamp. Use deep blue or red ink with light smudges for added realism. The stamp should appear slightly angled, as if hand-pressed. The passport page should show visible paper texture and security patterns.

## Notes
You can replace the city, country, landmark, and date placeholders. The example image uses "Rome", "Italy", "Colosseum", and "13 APR 2025" (date differs slightly from the base prompt structure). Prompt by [@M_w14_](https://x.com/M_w14_)
