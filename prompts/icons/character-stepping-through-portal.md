A 3D chibi-style version of the person in the photo is stepping through a glowing portal, reaching out and holding the viewer’s hand. As the character pulls the viewer forward, they turn back with a dynamic glance, inviting the viewer into their world.
Behind the portal is the viewer’s real-life environment: a typical programmer’s study with a desk, monitor, and laptop, rendered in realistic detail. Inside the portal lies the character’s 3D chibi world, inspired by the photo, with a cool blue color scheme that sharply contrasts with the real-world surroundings.
The portal itself is a perfectly elliptical frame glowing with mysterious blue and purple light, positioned at the center of the image as a gateway between the two worlds.
The scene is captured from a third-person perspective, clearly showing the viewer’s hand being pulled into the character’s world. Use a 2:3 aspect ratio.
