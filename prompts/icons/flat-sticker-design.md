Turn this photo into a chibi-style sticker illustration in a minimalist flat design.
– Keep the character’s recognizable features
– Use a cute, simplified aesthetic
– The sticker should have a thick white border
– The character should break out of the circular frame, adding a playful touch
– The circular base should be a solid flat color (no 3D or gradients)
– Background should be transparent
The overall style should be clean, modern, and visually appealing for use as a fun Q-version sticker.
