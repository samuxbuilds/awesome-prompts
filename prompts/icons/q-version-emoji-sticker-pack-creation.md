Create a brand-new set of chibi-style stickers featuring the user as the main character, with six unique poses:
  1.	Making a playful peace sign with both hands and winking.
  2.	Tearful eyes and slightly trembling lips, showing a cute crying expression.
  3.	Arms wide open in a warm, enthusiastic hug pose.
  4.	Lying on their side asleep, resting on a tiny pillow with a sweet smile.
  5.	Pointing forward with confidence, surrounded by shining visual effects.
  6.	Blowing a kiss, with heart symbols floating around.
Maintain the chibi aesthetic:
– Exaggerated, expressive big eyes
– Soft facial lines
– Playful, short black hairstyle
– A white outfit with a bold neckline design
Background: Vibrant red with star or colorful confetti elements for decoration. Leave some clean white space around each sticker.
Aspect ratio: 9:16
