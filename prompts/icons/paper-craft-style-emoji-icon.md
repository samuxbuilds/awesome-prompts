A paper craft-style "🔥" floating on a pure white background. The emoji is handcrafted from colorful cut paper with visible textures, creases, and layered shapes. It casts a soft drop shadow beneath, giving a sense of lightness and depth. The design is minimal, playful, and clean — centered in the frame with lots of negative space. Use soft studio lighting to highlight the paper texture and edges.

## Notes
The "🔥" emoji in the prompt can be replaced with other emojis.
