Generate an image: Transform the [🍓] into a creamy ice cream bar, with cream flowing in curved swirls on top, making it look delicious and tempting. The ice cream is floating at a 45-degree angle in mid-air, rendered in a cute chibi-style 3D aesthetic, set against a solid color background with a unified color palette.

## Notes
The 【🍓】 emoji in the prompt can be replaced with other emojis.
