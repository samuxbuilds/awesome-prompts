Create an image of a cute chibi-style silicone wrist rest based on the {🐼} emoji. The wrist rest is made of soft, food-grade silicone with a skin-friendly matte surface. The interior is filled with slow-rebound foam. Designed in a personified cartoon style, the expression is lively, with both arms stretched out as if hugging the user’s wrist while lying on a desk. The overall shape is round, soft, and adorable, featuring the classic {🐼} color scheme. The design is comforting and cute, suitable for office use. The background is a solid white color with soft lighting. Rendered in a product photography style, the angle is either front-facing or at a 45-degree top-down view, showcasing high-definition details and emphasizing the silicone texture and comfort functionality.

## Notes
Replace the {🐼} emoji in the prompt with other animal emojis.
