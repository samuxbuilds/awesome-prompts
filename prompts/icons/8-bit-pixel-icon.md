Create a minimalist 8-bit pixel logo of [🍔], centered on a pure white background. Use a limited retro color palette with pixelated detailing, sharp edges, and clean blocky forms. The logo should be simple, iconic, and clearly recognizable in pixel art style — inspired by classic arcade game aesthetics.

## Notes
The `[🍔]` emoji in the prompt can be replaced with other emojis or subjects.
