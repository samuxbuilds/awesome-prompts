ultra-realistic 3D render of four mechanical keyboard keycaps in a tight 2x2 grid, all keys touching. View from an isometric angle. One key is transparent with the word “{just}” printed in {white}. The other three colors are: {black, purple, and white}. One key features the {Github} logo. The other two say "{fork}" and "{it}". Realistic plastic texture, rounded sculpted keycaps, soft shadows, clean light-gray background.

## Notes
Replace brand name, slogan, keycap colors
