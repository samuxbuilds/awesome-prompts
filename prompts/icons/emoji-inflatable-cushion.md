Create a high-resolution 3D render of [🥹] designed as an inflatable, puffy object. The shape should appear soft, rounded, and air-filled — like a plush balloon or blow-up toy. Use a smooth, matte texture with subtle fabric creases and stitching to emphasize the inflatable look. The form should be slightly irregular and squishy, with gentle shadows and soft lighting that highlight volume and realism. Place it on a clean, minimal background (light gray or pale blue), and maintain a playful, sculptural aesthetic.

## Notes
The [🥹] emoji in the prompt can be replaced with other emojis.
