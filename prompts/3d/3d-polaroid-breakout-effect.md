Convert the character in the scene into a 3D chibi-style figure, placed inside a Polaroid photo. The photo paper is being held by a human hand. The character is stepping out of the Polaroid frame, creating a visual effect of breaking through the two-dimensional photo border and entering the real-world 3D space.

## Reference Image
A half-body or full-body single person photo.
