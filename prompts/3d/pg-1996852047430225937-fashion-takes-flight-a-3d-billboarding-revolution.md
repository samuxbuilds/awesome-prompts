Bold meets humor on busy streets! A striking figure bursts from a futuristic billboard, donning oversized streetwear and a cheeky tagline, redefining urban fashion flair.

## Prompt

```json
{
  "prompt": "A giant futuristic 3D fashion billboard installed on the side of a modern high-rise building in a busy urban street. On the 3D billboard is a confident man (from the uploaded image) styled in a bold, fashion-forward streetwear look — oversized jacket, cargo pants, and mismatched or random Converse-style sneakers. His pose is powerful and stylish, with one hand or shoe extending slightly outward from the frame, creating a realistic 3D pop-out effect as if he is stepping out of the billboard. Next to him, large premium-fashion typography reads: “LIMITED EDITION: OVERTHINKING SINCE BIRTH.” and below it, the tagline “BUT MAKE IT FASHION” in a contrasting modern layout. The visual tone blends luxury fashion aesthetics with humorous Gen-Z energy — photorealistic, stylish, meme-inspired, and culturally modern. Rendered in ultra-realistic detail. Vertical aspect ratio 3:4.",
