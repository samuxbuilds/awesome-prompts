Bold logos and playful icons dance across a creamy canvas, revealing the top 20 beverage titans. A vibrant infographic that celebrates industry growth with style!

## Prompt

Create a flat, minimalist infographic illustration on a [pale cream/off-white] background. The layout should feature a scattered arrangement of [20] distinct circles.

Interspersed between the company circles, place minimalist black line-art icons representing the industry, such as [soda cans, glass bottles, coffee cups, droplets, and leaves]. Add small decorative graphic elements like tiny black plus signs (+), small filled dots, and thin black arrows pointing upwards to indicate growth.

In the top left corner, place a bold title graphic text reading "[Top 20 Beverage Companies]". In the top right corner, clearly display a modern logo with the text "[SaaS Junction]".

The overall style should be corporate but playful, 2D vector art, high contrast, with no shading or 3D effects. Maintain a color palette of [Cream, Coral-Red, Black, and varied logo colors].
