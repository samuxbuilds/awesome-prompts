Tiny figures bring this cone to life with skiing thrills and playful antics! From daring jumps to a cute husky on a sled, this snowy scene packs endless winter excitement!

## Prompt

Add ultra-tiny realistic skiing, snowboarding, and winter-sports action figures interacting with the surfaces of the uploaded image. Place the miniature characters as if the object in the image is a snowy mountain slope. They should match the curvature, angles, and depth of the object naturally. Include variations like skiers carving turns, snowboarders jumping, climbers scaling the sides, and one or two funny moments (a skier falling, a snowboarder mid-flip, a tiny husky dog on a sled). Maintain scale extremely small and consistent. Blend shadows and reflections with high realism so they feel physically integrated on the object. Keep the original image style, lighting, and colors exactly the same. No distortion of the base object.
