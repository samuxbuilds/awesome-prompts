Imagine a snug haven where the ESC key morphs into a cozy living room, complete with popcorn and a glowing Netflix screen. Who needs reality when you can lounge with your favorite shows?

## Prompt

A photorealistic ESC keycap scene shows a miniature cozy living room setup. Inside: a glowing red Netflix screen, a plush red couch, popcorn bowl, and throw blanket. A small figure lounges with feet up, watching content. The red “N” logo glows from behind like mood lighting. Outside: cool tech-blue reflections on F1, Shift, and Q keys. The word “ESC” is subtly present in a glassy fog on top of the cap.
