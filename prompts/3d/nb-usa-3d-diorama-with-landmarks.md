*Create an isometric 3D diorama of US landmarks*

Create a high-detail 3D isometric diorama of the entire United States, where each state is represented as its own miniature platform. Inside each state, place a stylized, small-scale 3D model of that state's most iconic landmark. Use the same visual style as a cute, polished 3D city diorama: soft pastel colors, clean materials, smooth rounded forms, gentle shadows, and subtle reflections. Each landmark should look like a miniature model, charming, simplified, but clearly recognizable. Arrange the states in accurate geographical layout, with consistent lighting and perspective. Include state labels and landmark labels in a clean, modern font, floating above or near each model.
