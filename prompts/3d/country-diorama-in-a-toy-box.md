An ultra-realistic top-down photograph of a 3D-printed diorama inside a beige cardboard box, with the lid being held open by two human hands. The interior of the box reveals a miniature landscape of [COUNTRY NAME], featuring iconic landmarks, terrain, buildings, rivers, vegetation, and crowds of tiny, detailed human figures. The diorama is filled with vibrant, geographically appropriate elements, all crafted in a tactile, toy-like style using matte 3D-printed textures with visible layer lines. At the top, the inside of the box lid displays the phrase “[COUNTRY NAME]” in large, colorful, raised plastic letters—each letter in a different bright color. The lighting is warm and cinematic, highlighting the textures and shadows to evoke a sense of realism and charm, as if the viewer is opening a magical miniature version of the nation

## Notes
Please replace `[COUNTRY NAME]` in the prompt with a specific country name.
