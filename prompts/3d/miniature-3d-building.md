3D chibi-style miniature design of a whimsical Starbucks café, shaped like an oversized takeaway coffee cup complete with a lid and straw. The building has two floors, with large glass windows that clearly reveal a cozy and refined interior: wooden furniture, warm lighting, and busy baristas at work. On the street, cute little figurines are strolling or sitting, surrounded by benches, street lamps, and potted plants, creating a charming corner of the city. The overall aesthetic follows a detailed and realistic miniature cityscape style, with soft lighting that evokes a relaxing afternoon atmosphere.
