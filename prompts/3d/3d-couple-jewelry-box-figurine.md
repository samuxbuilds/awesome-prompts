Create a finely crafted, adorably charming 3D-rendered collectible figure based on the subjects in the photo, displayed inside a pastel-toned, warm and romantic presentation box. The box is designed in a soft cream color with gentle gold accents, resembling an elegant portable jewelry case.

When opened, the box reveals a heartwarming romantic scene: two chibi-style characters gazing sweetly at each other. The lid is engraved with the words “FOREVER TOGETHER,” surrounded by delicate star and heart motifs.

Inside the box stands the female from the photo, holding a small bouquet of white flowers. Beside her is her partner, the male from the photo. Both characters have large, expressive, sparkling eyes and soft, warm smiles that radiate affection and charm.

Behind them is a round window, through which a sunny skyline of a traditional Chinese town can be seen, along with gently drifting clouds. The interior is softly lit with warm ambient lighting, and petals float in the background to enhance the atmosphere.

The overall color scheme of both the display box and the characters is elegant and harmonious, creating a luxurious and dreamlike miniature keepsake.
