Transform the person in the photo into the style of a Funko Pop figure box, presented in isometric view.
The packaging is labeled with the title “JAMES BOND.”
Inside the box, display a chibi-style figure based on the person in the photo, along with their essential accessories: a pistol, a wristwatch, a suit, and other signature items.
Next to the box, show a realistic rendering of the actual figure outside the packaging, with detailed textures and lighting to achieve a lifelike product display.

## Reference Image
