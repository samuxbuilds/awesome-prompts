Can art capture the bizarre blend of power and fantasy? This striking image channels Bosch, showcasing a reptilian figure clutching the world, provoking thought on our leaders' influence.

## Prompt

The other day, while messing around with Nano Banana Pro, I randomly thought of Hieronymus Bosch. Then I got curious and asked Gemini to write a prompt around this idea: “a text-to-image prompt in the style of Hieronymus Bosch, featuring the most powerful people in the world, politicians, artists, tech giants, basically anyone shaping the world.”
That’s literally all I typed. And it produced something insanely strange. I made a few tweaks afterwards, but the final image is still wild, especially the reptilian guy holding the entire world. (And yes, the AI was clearly inspired by The Garden of Earthly Delights.)
