Imagine sipping coffee while gazing at Paris! This exquisite cup holds a tiny world, complete with the Eiffel Tower and bustling streets, all captured in stunning detail.

## Prompt

Prompt on Nano Banana Pro : White ceramic coffee cup rests on a smooth gray surface, its interior transformed into a miniature version of Paris. Instead of liquid, the cup contains tiny detailed streets, Haussmann-style buildings with gray rooftops, tree-lined boulevards, and small cafés with awnings. At the center rises a perfectly scaled Eiffel Tower, made of intricate metallic latticework, towering over a circular plaza and grassy park with tiny walking figures. Bridges span across a tiny river resembling the Seine that curves through the cup, with miniature boats floating beneath. The perspective is top-down, with gentle depth-of-field blur at the cup’s edges, focusing sharply on the Eiffel Tower as the focal point. Soft daylight casts realistic shadows, and the city textures—cobblestone streets, glass windows, and greenery—appear ultra-detailed, giving the illusion of a living Paris contained within a cup.
