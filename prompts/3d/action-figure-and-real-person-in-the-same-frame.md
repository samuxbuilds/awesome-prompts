In a casual, everyday style as if shot on a mobile phone, an anime figure of [Jackie Chan] is placed on a desk, striking an exaggerated and cool pose, fully equipped. Simultaneously, the corresponding real-life person also appears in the frame, striking a similar pose to the figure, creating an interesting visual contrast with the figure and the real person in the same frame. The overall composition is harmonious and natural, delivering a warm and vibrant, true-to-life visual experience.

## Notes
The [Jackie Chan] in the prompt can be replaced with the name of any figurine character you want, or other types of characters.
