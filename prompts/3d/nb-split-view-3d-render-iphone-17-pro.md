*Create a 3D render with realistic left half and wireframe right half*

Create a high-quality, realistic 3D render of exactly one instance of the object: [Orange iPhone 17 Pro].
The object must float freely in mid-air and be gently tilted and rotated in 3D space (not front-facing).
Use a soft, minimalist dark background in a clean 1080×1080 composition.
Left Half — Full Realism
The left half of the object should appear exactly as it looks in real life
— accurate materials, colors, textures, reflections, and proportions.
This half must be completely opaque with no transparency and no wireframe overlay.
No soft transition, no fading, no blending.
Right Half — Hard Cut Wireframe Interior
The right half must switch cleanly to a wireframe interior diagram.
The boundary between the two halves must be a perfectly vertical, perfectly sharp, crisp cut line, stretching straight from the top edge to the bottom edge of the object.
No diagonal edges, no curved slicing, no gradient.
The wireframe must use only two line colors:
Primary: white (≈80% of all lines)
Secondary: a color sampled from the dominant color of the realistic half (<20% of lines)
The wireframe lines must be thin, precise, aligned, and engineering-style.
Every wireframe component must perfectly match the geometry of the object.
Strict Single-Object Rule
Render only ONE object in the entire frame.  Render only one physical object.
Do NOT show a second object from any angle. Do NOT show a second object as a reflection, shadow, silhouette, outline, ghost image, or transparency. Do NOT show a second object for comparison or display purposes. Do NOT show both the front and the back separately.
Do NOT show an extra device behind, beside, underneath, or partially hidden.
Only one single object is allowed in the entire frame.
No duplicate objects, no mirrored back-and-front pairings, no reflections showing a second object.
The object must appear alone, floating.
Pose & Lighting:
Apply a natural, subtle tilt + rotation in 3D to make it look like a floating product visualization.
Use soft, neutral global illumination and no shadows under the object.
No extra props, no text, no labels unless explicitly requested.
