A cozy 90s living room springs to life with glowing screens and plush vibes! Who wouldn't want to escape into this vintage gaming paradise, joystick in hand?

## Prompt

A photorealistic ESC keycap scene shows a miniature cozy living room from 90s.. Inside: a glowing nostalgic of 90s screen with a video game playing, a plush couch, joysticks, gaming console, and throw blanket. A small figure lounges with feet up, watching content. The gaming screen glows from behind like mood lighting. Outside: cool tech reflections on F1, Shift, and Q keys. The word “ESC” is subtly present in a glassy fog on top of the cap.
