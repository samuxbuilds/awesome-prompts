*Create a premium 3D Christmas tree built entirely from brand products and packaging*

```json
{
  "brand": "{{brand}}",
  "brand_analysis": {
    "colors": "Automatically adapt to the brand's primary and secondary colors as seen on its real products and packaging, with subtle Christmas-season warmth.",
    "key_elements": "Any physical products, packaging, or merchandise belonging to the brand, used as modular building blocks."
  },
  "prompt": "A clean, highly detailed 3D render of a Brand Christmas Tree built entirely from {{brand}} products and packaging. The items are stacked in a perfect pyramid, with the largest elements at the base and the smallest toward the top, forming a clear Christmas tree silhouette. The style is premium, playful, and advertising-focused. Isometric miniature composition, studio photography look. Rendered in Cinema 4D (C4D) with Octane Render, ultra-smooth surfaces, accurate product proportions, and high realism. Minimal pastel or neutral background chosen to contrast the brand's colors. Soft volumetric studio lighting, gentle global illumination, subtle shadows, warm festive mood created through lighting and arrangement only. No text, no captions, no extra logos beyond what already appears on the products. Clean, modern, reusable, brand-agnostic Christmas advertising artwork."
}
