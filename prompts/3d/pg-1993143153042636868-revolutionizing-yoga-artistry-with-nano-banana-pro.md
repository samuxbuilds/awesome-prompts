Create a photoreal editorial fitness portrait of the same adult woman.

Reproduce the exact seated yoga pose from the depth map without changing limb angles or silhouette: left leg folded, right leg extended vertically upward on the same axis as the depth reference, both hands holding the raised foot/ankle at the same height and orientation, hips grounded, spine tall, shoulders relaxed. Bare legs and bare feet with realistic toe spacing and stretch tension. Outfit: fitted cobalt-blue sports bra, tight clean-white yoga shorts. Add a hyper-realistic 3D optical-illusion snake tattoo coiling around the raised right shin and calf—ink embedded in skin with crisp scale texture, believable depth shading, and soft cast shadows aligned to the window light so it looks alive but clearly tattooed. Scene: bohemian minimalist home yoga space with macrame wall hanging, framed yoga illustration leaning against wall, dried cotton stems in a glass vase, sheer white curtains, light glossy tiles, purple circular yoga mat. Soft natural window light from camera-left, diffuse shadows, clean HDR. Raw photoreal, subtle grain, mild vignette, no stylization."
