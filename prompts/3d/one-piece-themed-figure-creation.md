Transform the person in the photo into a One Piece-themed anime-style action figure, presented inside a collectible figure box designed in the visual style of the One Piece universe. The box is shown in an isometric view.
Inside the box, display the character reimagined in the One Piece anime art style, posed dynamically and accompanied by essential everyday items such as a pistol, a wristwatch, a suit, and leather shoes — all miniaturized and arranged like collectible accessories.
Next to the box, include a realistic, fully rendered version of the actual figure itself, outside of the packaging. This figure should be rendered with high detail and realism, showcasing the material textures and craftsmanship, as if it were a professionally photographed product.

## Notes
