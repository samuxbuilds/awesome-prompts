Hyperrealistic, top-down bird's-eye view shot, a beautiful Instagram model [Anne Hathaway / see reference image], with exquisite and beautiful makeup and fashionable styling, standing on the screen of a smartphone held up by someone. The image creates a strong perspective illusion. Emphasize the 3D effect of the girl standing out from the phone. She wears black-rimmed glasses, high-street fashion, and strikes a cute, playful pose. The phone screen is treated as a dark floor, like a small stage. The scene uses strong forced perspective to show the proportional difference between the hand, the phone, and the girl. The background is clean gray, using soft indoor light, shallow depth of field, and the overall style is surrealistic photorealistic compositing. Very strong perspective.
