Generate a vertically-oriented image based on my uploaded photo, using the following prompt:
Classic LEGO minifigure style in a miniature scene — an animal stands beside me. The color palette of the animal should match mine.
Please design the animal based on your understanding of me. You may choose any creature — real, surreal, or fantastical — that you feel best reflects my personality.
The entire scene is set within a transparent glass cube, with a minimalist interior design.
The base of the miniature is matte black with silver accents, following a clean and modern aesthetic.
On the base, there is an elegantly engraved nameplate in a refined serif font, displaying the name of the animal.
The lower part of the base subtly incorporates finely etched biological classification details, similar to a natural history museum display.
The overall composition should resemble a high-end collectible artwork: meticulously crafted, curated in style, and lit with refined lighting.
Balance is key to the layout. The background should feature a smooth gradient transition from dark to light tones, selected to match the dominant color theme.
