    "title": "Creative Conceptual Portrait – Miniature Clone Photography Scene",
    "description": "An ultra-realistic, high-detail conceptual portrait set in a dark, premium editorial studio environment. The main subject (use the exact facial features from the reference photo for full accuracy) is seated at a reflective glass table, holding a professional DSLR camera with both hands. The subject looks downward with a focused, thoughtful expression. Surrounding the main subject, multiple miniature clones—each with the same face, same outfit, and identical overall appearance—interact creatively with the camera equipment. Some tiny clones climb on large camera lenses, some sit casually on the table, some stand on the subject’s shoulders, and others walk around the scene, creating a lively micro-world around the main figure.",
