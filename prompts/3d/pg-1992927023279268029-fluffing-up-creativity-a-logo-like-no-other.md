Can a logo be cozy? This fluffy 3D creation defies convention, floating softly against a light gray backdrop, radiating warmth and whimsy with its hyperrealistic fur texture.

## Prompt

Transform a simple flat vector logo into a soft, 3D fluffy object. Use the exact colors. The shape is fully covered in fur, with hyperrealistic hair texture and soft shadows. The object is centered on a clean, light gray background and floats gently in space. The style is surreal, tactile, and modern, evoking a sense of comfort and playfulness. Studio lighting, high-resolution render.
