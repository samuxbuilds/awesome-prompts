Who knew minimalism could come alive? Delightful, clean line-drawings of people gracefully mingle with the scene, adding warmth and whimsy without overshadowing the environment.

## Prompt

Add clean, minimal white line-drawing illustrations of people into this photo. Match the perspective, lighting, and scale of the scene. The illustrated figures should interact naturally and meaningfully with the environment, reflecting the mood, purpose, and activity of the space. Keep the drawings simple, fluid, and expressive, with no facial details. Maintain a modern, warm, and slightly whimsical tone that complements the overall aesthetic. Do not obscure any original elements. The illustrated figures should feel like friendly, imaginative additions that blend seamlessly with the context of the scene.
