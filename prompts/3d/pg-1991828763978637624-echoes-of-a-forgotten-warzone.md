Amidst the desolation, a lone figure stands guard. The rugged man, dust-laden and resolute, holds his shotgun tight as shadows dance over a rusted helicopter—a relic of past battles. Beneath the brooding sky, the stillness tells stories of survival and grit.

## Prompt

Cinematic full-body portrait of a rugged man holding a shotgun, standing beside an old, rusted helicopter in front of a weathered wooden building on an abandoned farm. The ground is dry and cracked, tall brown grass sways in the wind, and the sky is overcast with dramatic gray clouds. The man’s clothes are dusty — a worn leather jacket, jeans, and boots. Faded paint and rust streaks cover the helicopter’s body. The atmosphere feels tense and post-apocalyptic, with cinematic lighting and soft depth of field.
