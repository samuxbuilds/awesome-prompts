A whimsical gathering unfolds as vibrant birds flock to a seed-laden feeder, basking in warm morning light. Nature's palette dances in harmony, crafting a serene yet lively tableau.

## Prompt

A flat wooden bird feeder sprinkled with seeds rests on a sunlit garden table, rendered in smooth airbrush gradients. A lively circle of colorful birds--blue tits, finches, robins, and tiny parakeet-like visitors--gathers around the edges, their feathers softly blended for a gentle, painted glow. Morning light filters through nearby branches in soft, diffused beams, creating warm, hazy dappled shadows. The whole scene feels vibrant yet calm, with smooth transitions, radiant color, and a balanced composition that stays cheerful without feeling crowded.
