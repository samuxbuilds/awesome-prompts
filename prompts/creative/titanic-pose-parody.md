Transform the person in the attached image into a cute chibi-style 3D character.
Scene: On the pointed bow of a luxurious cruise ship.
The man stands behind the woman at the bow, holding her waist with both hands. The woman is wearing a dress, arms spread wide, facing the wind, with a joyful and liberated expression on her face—just like the iconic scene from Titanic.
The sky is painted in warm sunset tones, and the vast ocean stretches beneath the ship.
Only the characters should be in chibi 3D style; the rest of the environment should be realistic.
