*Photorealistic documentation of a chalkboard anime drawing*

{
  "intent": "Photorealistic documentation of a specific chalkboard art piece featuring a single anime character, capturing the ephemeral nature of the medium within a classroom context.",
  "frame": {
    "aspect_ratio": "4:3",
    "composition": "A centered medium shot focusing on the chalkboard mural. The composition includes the teacher's desk in the immediate foreground to provide scale, with the artwork of the single character dominating the background space.",
    "style_mode": "documentary_realism, texture-focused, ambient naturalism"
  },
  "subject": {
    "primary_subject": "A large-scale, intricate chalk drawing of Boa Hancock from 'One Piece' on a standard green classroom blackboard.",
    "visual_details": "The illustration depicts Boa Hancock in a commanding pose, positioned centrally on the board. She is drawn with her signature long, straight black hair with a hime cut, rendered using dense application of black chalk with white accents for sheen. Her expression is haughty and imperious, with detailed dark blue eyes. She is depicted forming a heart shape with her hands, referencing her 'Mero Mero Mellow' technique. She wears a revealing red blouse with purple geometric patterns and gold snake-shaped earrings, drawn with vibrant colored chalks.",
    "medium_texture": "The image preserves the dusty, matte quality of the chalk. Visible hatching and cross-hatching strokes create shading on her clothing and hair. Smudged areas on the green slate indicate where colors have been blended by hand.",
    "surrounding_elements": "To the right of the character, vertical Japanese text reading '海賊女帝' (Pirate Empress) is written in crisp white chalk."
  },
  "environment": {
    "location": "A standard Japanese school classroom.",
    "foreground_elements": "A wooden teacher's desk occupies the lower foreground. Scattered across the surface are a yellow box of colored chalks, loose sticks of red, white, and blue pastel chalk, and a dust-covered black felt eraser.",
    "background_elements": "The green chalkboard spans the width of the frame, bordered by a metallic chalk tray containing accumulated chalk dust. The wall above is a plain, off-white plaster, featuring a small mounted speaker box.",
    "atmosphere": "Quiet and academic, with a sense of stillness suggesting the room is currently unoccupied."
  },
  "lighting": {
    "type": "Diffuse ambient classroom lighting.",
    "quality": "Soft, nondirectional illumination provided by overhead fluorescent fixtures mixed with daylight from windows on the left. The light is even, preventing glare on the chalkboard surface while highlighting the texture of the chalk.",
    "color_temperature": "Neutral white, approximately 5000K, ensuring accurate color rendition of the red and purple chalks against the dark green board.",
    "direction": "Overhead and slightly frontal."
  },
  "camera": {
    "sensor_format": "35mm full-frame digital sensor.",
    "lens": "35mm prime lens.",
    "aperture": "f/5.6",
    "depth_of_field": "Moderate depth of field, keeping the chalkboard drawing in sharp focus while allowing the foreground desk elements to soften slightly.",
    "shutter_speed": "1/60s",
    "iso": "400",
    "camera_position": "Eye-level standing position, set back enough to frame the entire drawing and the desk."
  },
  "negative": {
    "content": "Multiple characters, Midoriya, Shigaraki, male characters, digital art overlay, vector graphics, paper texture, oil painting, messy composition, extreme low angle, fisheye lens.",
    "style": "No hyper-saturation, no soft focus filters, no heavy vignetting."
  }
