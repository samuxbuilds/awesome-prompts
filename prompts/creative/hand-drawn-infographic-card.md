Create a hand-drawn style infographic card in a 9:16 vertical format. The card should have a clear theme, with a beige or off-white paper-textured background. The overall design should reflect a simple, warm, and handmade aesthetic.

At the top of the card, use large, eye-catching brush-style Chinese cursive calligraphy in red and black for the title, creating strong visual contrast. All text should be in Chinese cursive script. The layout should be divided into 2 to 4 clear sections, each conveying a core idea through concise and refined Chinese phrases. The calligraphy should maintain a fluid, rhythmic style that is both legible and artistically expressive. Leave appropriate blank space around the text.

The card should be accented with simple and fun hand-drawn illustrations or icons — such as figures or symbolic elements — to enhance visual appeal and spark thought or emotional resonance. The overall layout should emphasize visual balance and include ample whitespace, ensuring the design is clean, clear, and easy to read.
