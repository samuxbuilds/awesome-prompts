*Removes unwanted people from backgrounds and fills the space with logical textures.*

Remove all the tourists/people in the background behind the main subject. Intelligent Fill : Replace them with realistic background elements that logically fit the scene (e.g., extend the cobblestone pavement, empty park benches, or grass textures). Consistency : Ensure no blurry artifacts or 'smudges' remain. The filled area must have the same grain, focus depth, and lighting as the rest of the photo.
