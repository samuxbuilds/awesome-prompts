Create a two-panel vertical manga in a cute Japanese anime style, theme: “The Daily Work Life of a Girl President.”

Character Design:
Transform the person in the uploaded image into a cute, moe-style anime girl while preserving all key details from the photo — including the outfit (a suit), hairstyle (bright golden-yellow), and facial features.

Panel 1:
- Expression: Pouting, disappointed, resting her cheek on one hand
- Text box: “What do I dooo?! He won’t take my call! (；´д｀)”
- Scene: Warm-toned office, with the U.S. flag in the background. On the desk: a pile of hamburgers and a vintage red rotary phone. The character is on the left side of the frame, the phone on the right.

Panel 2:
- Expression: Furious, face red with anger, gritting teeth
- Action: Slams the desk hard, making the hamburgers jump
- Speech bubble: “Hmph! Double the tariffs! Ignoring me is their loss! ( `д´ )”
- Scene: Same office, now a complete mess

Additional Notes:
- Use a cute, casual handwritten font for all text
- Keep the composition full and expressive, with adequate space for dialogue and intentional white space
- Aspect ratio: 2:3
- The overall visual tone should be colorful and energetic, with a distinctly cartoony style

## Reference Image
A photo of a person is needed for reference.
