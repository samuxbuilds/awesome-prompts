Create a hand-drawn style infographic card in vertical 9:16 ratio. The card should have a clear theme, with a beige or off-white paper-textured background. The overall design should convey a rustic, friendly, and handmade aesthetic.

At the top of the card, feature a bold, eye-catching title in large Chinese cursive brush calligraphy using contrasting red and black colors. All text content should be in Chinese cursive script, and the layout should be divided into 2 to 4 clear sections. Each section expresses a core idea with brief and concise Chinese phrases. The cursive font should retain a smooth, rhythmic flow, remaining legible while carrying artistic appeal.

The card should include simple, playful hand-drawn illustrations or icons, such as figures or symbolic elements, to enhance visual interest and spark reader reflection or emotional resonance.

The overall layout should maintain visual balance, with ample white space reserved to ensure clarity, simplicity, and ease of reading and understanding.
<h1><span style="color:red">“Cognition”</span> defines your ceiling  
<span style="color:red">“Circle”</span> defines your opportunities</h1>  
– You can’t earn money beyond your level of cognition,  
– Nor encounter opportunities beyond your social circle.
