Generate a Q-style 3D C4D-rendered character based on the person in the photo, dressed in a fashion-forward “outfit of the day” (OOTD) inspired by a specific profession.
Profession: Fashion Designer
– Keep the original facial features and character pose
– Stylize the character with a cute, long-legged chibi proportion
– Outfit and accessories should reflect the profession, including trendy designer wear, glasses, sketchbook or tablet, and stylish shoes
– Match the outfit with fashion accessories to complete the look
– Use a solid background color that complements the character’s overall color palette (no gradients or textures)

Composition: Aspect ratio: 9:16
Top text: “OOTD”
Left side: the full-body chibi character wearing the complete outfit
Right side: individual clothing items and accessories laid out separately, as if in a style breakdown
