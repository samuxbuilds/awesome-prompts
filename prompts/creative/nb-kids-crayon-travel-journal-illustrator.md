*Generate a childlike travel journal illustration for a city*

--- Prompt ---

Please create a vibrant, child-like crayon-style vertical (9:16) illustration titled "{City Name} Travel Journal."  
The artwork should look as if it were drawn by a curious child using colorful crayons, featuring a soft, warm light-toned background (such as pale yellow), combined with bright reds, blues, greens, and other cheerful colors to create a cozy, playful travel atmosphere.

I. Main Scene: Travel-Journal Style Route Map

In the center of the illustration, draw a "winding, zigzagging travel route" with arrows and dotted lines connecting multiple locations.  
The route should automatically generate recommended attractions based on {Number of Days}:

Example structure (auto-filled with {City Name}-related content):

- "Stop 1: {Attraction 1 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 2: {Attraction 2 + short fun description}"
- "Stop 3: {Attraction 3 + short fun description}"
- …
- "Final Stop: {Local signature food or souvenir + warm closing remark}"

Rules:
- If no number of days is provided, default to a 1-day highlight itinerary.

II. Surrounding Playful Elements (Auto-adapt to the City)

Add many cute doodles and child-like decorative elements around the route, such as:

1. Adorable travel characters
   - A child holding a local snack  
   - A little adventurer with a backpack

2. Q-style hand-drawn iconic landmarks
   - "{City Landmark 1}"
   - "{City Landmark 2}"
   - "{City Landmark 3}"

3. Funny signboards
   - "Don't get lost!"
   - "Crowds ahead!"
   - "Yummy food this way!"  
   (Auto-adjust contextually for the city)

4. Sticker-style short phrases
   - "{City Name} travel memories unlocked!"
   - "{City Name} food adventure!"
   - "Where to next?"

5. Cute icons of local foods
   - "{Local Food 1}"
   - "{Local Food 2}"
   - "{Local Food 3}"

6. Childlike exclamations
   - "I didn't know {City Name} was so fun!"
   - "I want to come again!"

III. Overall Art Style Requirements

- Crayon / children's hand-drawn travel diary style  
- Bright, warm, colorful palette  
- Cozy but full and lively composition  
- Emphasize the joy of exploring  
- All text should be in a cute handwritten font  
- Make the entire page feel like a young child's fun travel-journal entry
