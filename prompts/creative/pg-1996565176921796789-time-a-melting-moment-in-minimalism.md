A stunning visual language unfolds as the word 'TIME' transforms. A candle melts elegantly, capturing the essence of fleeting moments against a serene gradient backdrop.

## Prompt

Design a minimalist poster of the word "TIME" in a clean sans-serif font. Replace the letter "I" with a melting candle, subtly dripping wax, symbolizing the passage of time. The background is a soft gradient from deep navy to pale dawn. Add a faint shadow from the candle and soft glow from its flame. Typography is centered with balanced spacing. High-resolution vector style.
