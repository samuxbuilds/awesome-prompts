An ultra-photorealistic, cinematic-style illustration depicting Lara Croft dynamically bursting through the frame of an “Archaeological Adventure” trading card. She is caught mid-jump or swinging on a rope, wearing her iconic adventurer outfit and possibly firing dual pistols. The muzzle flashes help shatter the card’s ancient stone-carved border, creating a visible dimensional rupture with energy cracks and spatial distortions, scattering dust and debris outward.

Her body lunges forward with powerful momentum, breaking through the card’s flat plane, emphasizing strong motion depth. Inside the card (the background) is a depiction of dense jungle ruins or a trap-filled ancient tomb. The shattered card fragments mix with crumbling stone, flying vines, broken ancient coins, and spent shell casings.

The title “Archaeological Adventure” and the name “Lara Croft” (accompanied by a stylized artifact icon) remain visible on the remaining cracked and weathered parts of the card. The scene is lit with adventurous, dynamic lighting that emphasizes her agility and the perilous environment.

## Notes
The original tweet mentioned key terms are "dimensional break effects" and "motion depth". The prompt above is a reconstruction based on the description.
