Create an original creature inspired by this object (photo provided). The creature should look like it belongs in a fantasy monster-catching universe, with a cute or cool design influenced by retro Japanese RPG monster art. The image must include:
– A full-body view of the creature, inspired by the shape, materials or purpose of the object.
– A small orb or capsule (similar an a pokeball) at its feet, designed with patterns and colors matching the object’s look — not a standard Pokéball, but a custom design.
– An invented name for the creature, displayed next to or below it. – Its elemental type (e.g., Fire, Water, Metal, Nature, Electric…), based on the object’s core properties. The illustration should look like it comes from a fantasy creature encyclopedia, with clean lines, soft shadows, and an expressive, character-driven design.
