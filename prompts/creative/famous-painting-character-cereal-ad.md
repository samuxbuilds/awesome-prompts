“Master Oats”: Based on the visual features of the person in the uploaded photo, generate a custom oatmeal mix that reflects their personality traits — for example, using vegetables, fruits, yogurt, whole grains, etc.

Design a unique cereal box and package aesthetic that aligns with this tailored mix.

Then, create an advertising cover featuring the person as the mascot on the cereal box. The character should retain their recognizable features but be transformed into a cute chibi-style 3D figure with a C4D-quality rendering.

The oatmeal and packaging should be presented in a setting that matches the mood — such as a minimalist kitchen, a sleek supermarket display, or a clean design counter.

The process includes:
– Character analysis and oat mix pairing
– Cereal box concept and design
– Display environment selection
– Final image with mascot figure, packaging, and styled scene composition

All visuals should be balanced, modern, and appealing, reflecting a premium and fun oat brand identity.
