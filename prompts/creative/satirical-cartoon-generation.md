An illustration in satirical comic style, rendered in a vintage American comic aesthetic. The background features a multi-tiered shelf stocked entirely with identical red baseball caps. The caps have a bold slogan on the front: “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,” while a white side tag on each reads “MADE IN CHINA.” The composition uses a close-up perspective focusing on one specific red cap.
At the bottom of the image, a price label is shown: the original price “$50.00” is crossed out with a thick black X and replaced with “$77.00.” The overall color palette uses nostalgic ochre and deep red tones, with shading that mimics the textured print style of 1990s retro comics.
The composition is exaggerated and satirical, carrying a strong critique of political consumerism.
