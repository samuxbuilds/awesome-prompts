Transform your visuals! Chiaroscuro brings stunning depth with its dynamic interplay of light and shadow, echoing the masterful works of Renaissance legends.

## Prompt

Chiaroscuro is an artistic technique using strong light-dark contrasts to create depth and volume in two-dimensional works. The Italian term means “light-dark.” While used throughout art history, it became especially prominent during the Renaissance and Baroque periods in works by Caravaggio, Rembrandt, and Leonardo da Vinci, who employed it for dramatic effect and atmosphere.
