*Translates comics or memes by scrubbing text bubbles and replacing content with matching fonts.*

Translate the text in the speech bubbles/captions from [Japanese/English] to [Chinese]. Seamless Cleaning : Erase the original text and perfectly fill the background (e.g., the white speech bubble or the colored image background). Style Matching : Render the translated Chinese text using a casual, handwritten-style font (or bold impact font for memes) that matches the aesthetic of the original image. Fit : Ensure the text fits naturally within the bubbles without overcrowding.
