*A hyperrealistic anime-style portrait with dramatic lighting*

Generate a hyperrealistic realistic-anime portrait of a female character standing in a completely black background.
Lighting: use a **narrow beam spotlight** focused only on the center of the face. 
The edges of the light must be sharp and dramatic. 
All areas outside the spotlight should fall quickly into deep darkness 
(high falloff shadow), almost blending into the black background. 
Not soft lighting.
Hair: long dark hair with some strands falling over the face. The lower parts of the hair should fade into the shadows.
Pose: one hand raised gently to the lips in a shy, hesitant gesture. 
Eyes looking directly at the camera with a mysterious mood.
Clothing: black long-sleeve knit sweater; 
the sweater and body should mostly disappear into the darkness with minimal detail.
Overall tone: dark, moody, dramatic, mysterious. 
High-contrast only in the lit portion of the face. 
Everything outside the spotlight should be nearly invisible.
