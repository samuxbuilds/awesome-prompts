*Test the model's ability to replicate specific film textures, flash photography, and era-specific atmosphere.*

Without changing her original face, create a portrait of a beautiful young woman with porcelain-white skin, captured with a 1990s-style camera using a direct front flash. Her messy dark brown hair is tied up, posing with a calm yet playful smile. She wears a modern oversized cream sweater. The background is a dark white wall covered with aesthetic magazine posters and stickers, evoking a cozy bedroom or personal room atmosphere under dim lighting. The 35mm lens flash creates a nostalgic glow.
