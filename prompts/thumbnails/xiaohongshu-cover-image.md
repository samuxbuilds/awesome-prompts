Draw an image: Create a cover for a Xiaohongshu (RED) post.

Requirements:
– It must be visually compelling enough to attract user clicks.
– Use bold, characterful fonts.
– Vary font sizes to reflect the hierarchy of information; emphasize the structure of the copy.
– The main title should be at least twice the size of regular text.
– Leave white space between text sections.
– Only use bright accent colors to highlight key words and draw attention.
– The background should feature an eye-catching pattern (such as paper texture, notebook, or a WeChat chat window—choose one).
– Add appropriate icons or illustrations to enhance visual layers, but avoid visual clutter.
