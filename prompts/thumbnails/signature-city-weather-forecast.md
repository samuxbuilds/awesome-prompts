Show a clear 45-degree bird’s-eye view of an isometric miniature city scene featuring Shanghai’s iconic buildings, such as the Oriental Pearl Tower and the Bund. The weather effect—cloudy—blends softly into the city, interacting gently with the architecture. Use physically based rendering (PBR) and realistic lighting. Solid color background, crisp and clean. Centered composition to highlight the precision and detail of the 3D model. Display “Shanghai Cloudy 20°C” and a cloudy weather icon at the top of the image.

## Notes
The city, weather, temperature, and building names can be replaced with the content in []. Generated with sora.
