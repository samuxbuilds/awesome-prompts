A vertical (3:4) 4K-resolution minimalist futurist exhibition poster with an ultra-light cool gray background (#f4f4f4).

At the center of the poster is a fluid 3D metaball shaped like a classic Coca-Cola bottle in full form, rendered in frosted glass with delicate grainy noise.
The fluid gradient transitions from Coca-Cola Red (#E41C23) to Pearl White (#FFFFFF), giving it a silky glass-like appearance.

High-position softbox lighting casts long, soft colored shadows and a subtle halo.

The fluid overlaps with the text: letters obscured by the frosted glass appear with a gentle Gaussian blur.
•The main title, the classic red “Coca-Cola” logo, is centered and partially obscured by the fluid. The covered letters are slightly blurred through the frosted glass.
•The subtitle, in bold all-caps modern sans-serif pure black font, reads: “TASTE THE FEELING”, placed below the main title. It is also partially overlapped by the fluid and blurred in those areas, while the rest remains sharp.

The overall layout is clean with generous whitespace, balanced composition, sharp focus, and HDR high dynamic range.

## Notes
The [Classic 3D Coca-Cola Bottle] in the prompt can be replaced with descriptions of other items to generate posters with different themes.
