Transform the image to an ancient treasure map drawn on aged parchment. The map includes detailed elements like sailing ships on the ocean, old ports or castles on the coastline, a dotted path leading to a large 'X' marking the treasure spot, mountains, palm trees, and a decorative compass rose. The overall style is reminiscent of old pirate adventure films.

## Reference Image
A Google Maps screenshot or other map image needs to be uploaded as the basis for the transformation.
