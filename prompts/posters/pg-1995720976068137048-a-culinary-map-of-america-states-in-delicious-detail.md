Can food shape geography? This innovative map reimagines the USA with each state crafted from its iconic dishes. A feast for the eyes and the imagination!

## Prompt

create a map of the US where every state is made out of its most famous food (the states should actually look like they are made of the food, not a picture of the food). Check carefully to make sure each state is right.
