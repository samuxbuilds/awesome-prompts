{The Lord of the Rings} anime film poster, the anime is in the style of High School DXD. Visible even folds are seen across the poster as it’s been folded over time, and due to some creases over damaging the poster has caused some physical damage scuffing along the creases and the color has partially faded. Indiscriminate flaps and folds and scratches all around simply from moving back and forth causing subtle yet incremental damage with the ever expanding of entropy we cannot escape, but the loving memories in our hearts will forever be whole. Making the objects we collect along the way priceless is the essence you feel when looking at this nostalgic poster.

## Notes
You can replace the movie title "{The Lord of the Rings}" in the prompt with others. Be aware that some movie titles may trigger content moderation. The referenced anime style can also be modified.
